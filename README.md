## Bryn Williams

I am an entrepreneur at heart. Since 2015 I have worked in various roles in physical education (PE) and this inspired me to start my own business, running sports clubs, in 2019. Throughout this, technology has always excited me thinking about how technologies can and do play a role in sport but also due to the innovation and need to problem solve.

## Work Experience

**Sports Specialists Limited** (2018 to 2021)  
Director

- Managing finances: I organised payments, paid out invoices and was in regular communication with the accountants.
- Organising and planning staffing: I was responsible for organising which staff were at which location, ensuring the duo could work exceptionally well together and allocate lead coach's for each site.
- Managing customer database: I was in charge of inputting and maintaining customer information.
- Sorting issues:  I was the point of contact for staff who had problems and for customers who had any issues.

**Royal Kent School** (2019 to 2021)  
Sports Coach

- Lesson planning: Planning lessons required good teamwork, being coordinated with the PE team in order to bounce ideas off each other and create effective lessons.
- Leading sports lessons: I was responsible for delivering a number of sports programs across the school. This involved innovative thinking, clear communication, leadership and problem solving skills.

**Royal Kent School** (September 2018 â€“ August 2021)
Learning Support Assistant

- Taking small groups in classroom subjects - This requires me to have attention to detail in seeing how the children are working and in aiding them through their learning.

**Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School** (September 2015 - July 2017)
Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School

- Managing Sports Teams - Every term, I was given a team to manage for matches and tournaments. Therefore, I had to be organised in setting up training sessions, decisive in picking teams and making decisions on match days.

## Skills

- Problem Solving: I got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2014. This meant that my walking ability slowly deteriorated. This means I now come across daily challenges in general life which I have to work out ways to overcome. It also meant I had to rethink how I was going to remain involved in sport. In my roles both as a teacher and as a business owner I would have to problem solve issues ranging from safeguarding concerns, health and safety concerns to parent issues. The solution usually came from thinking about the problem, deciding on a plan of action and finally implementing the plan. If success was not achieved, I would start the process again attacking the problem from a different angle.

- Organisation and planning: When running my business I had to coordinate with several different schools about club running times and also organising the club staffing. This required good communication skills but also for me to think about the logistics of club timings, clubs running simultaneously, the number of staff I had, child to stuff numbers ratio, contingency plans and the minimum number of customers need and the maximum we could accept.

- Teamwork: While in my sports coaching roles at schools I had to work as part of a team, this lends myself to being a strong pair programmer. To achieve success at my previous jobs good communication was key in order to arrive at certain decisions. I also found that as well as communication skills, the environment created needs to be one where people arent afraid to suggest ideas and people should be able to bounce ideas off one another to find a final solution.
