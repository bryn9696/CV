## Bryn Williams

I am a talented and collaborative software engineer with excellent problem-solving skills and an entrepreneurial spirit. I completed a degree in sport and fitness and have since successfully pivoted to software engineering. I took the opportunity to undergo bootcamp training to build a solid foundation to my knowledge and have completed a competitive and challenging graduate programme with a fintech consultancy (references available upon request). I am now looking for my next step into the world of software engineering and am immediately available for employment.

## Core Skills

- Programming languages/ frameworks: Java, Cucumber, Junit, Aeron, Spring, gRPC, SQL, Ruby, JavaScript.
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development.
- Strong communicator, able to motivate and engage teams.

## Work Experience

**Java Software Engineer** (February 2023 to July 2023)

I was selected from hundreds of candidates for this exciting and challenging graduate programme. I received intense training in Java before exploring further frameworks. After this, I was working on projects either individually or in a team to meet the requests of stakeholders. I worked on these projects in an agile environment. The company had a strong culture of continual personal development and learning and so the pressure to absorb and then implement what we learned was considerable.

- Agile: Collaborated in agile teams to successfully deliver software solutions, ensuring efficient and timely project completion.
- Problem solving: Developed innovative programs to address complex financial scenarios, showcasing strong problem-solving skills.
- Planning: Skillfully managed sprint backlogs and daily workload, ensuring optimal planning and prioritisation of tasks.
- Adaptability: Demonstrated adaptable nature by promptly responding to clients' evolving requirements and seamlessly incorporating changes into the product.
- Communication: Effectively communicated progress and accomplishments to clients during demos, as well as facilitated team collaboration through clear and concise communication.
- Time management: Exhibited excellent time management skills, meeting project milestones and deadlines.
- Technical: Technologies used included Java, Cucumber, Junit, Aeron, Spring, gRPC, SQL, JavaScript.
**Sports Specialists Limited** (2018 to 2021)  
Director

I built this company from nothing to operating across 3 schools, with 5 clubs and holiday camps.

- Organising: Allocating which staff were at which location and allocating lead coach's for each site to deliver exceptional sport sessions.
- Planning: Pairing coaches who could work well together to enable smooth running sessions.
- Flexibility and adaptability: Adjusting when staff were out or for any conflicts arose.
- Managing customer database: Inputting and maintaining customer information.
- Problem solving: Point of contact for staff and customers who had any problems or issues as well as being the person to sort any logistical problems. This lead to a smoother running of the company.

**Royal Kent School** (2019 to 2021)  
Sports Coach

- Lesson planning: Required good teamwork, being coordinated with the PE team in order to bounce ideas off each other and create effective lessons.
- Leading sports lessons: Responsible for delivering a number of sports programs across the school. This involved innovative thinking, clear communication, leadership and problem solving skills.

**Royal Kent School** (September 2018 â€“ August 2021)
Learning Support Assistant

- Small group work: Attention to detail in order to see how children were working and aiding them through their learning.

**Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School** (September 2015 - July 2017)
Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School

- Managing Sports Teams: Every term, I was given a team to manage for matches and tournaments. Therefore, I had to be organised in setting up training sessions, decisive in picking teams and making decisions on match days.

## Skills

- Problem Solving: I got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2014. This meant that my walking ability slowly deteriorated. This means I now come across daily challenges in general life which I have to work out ways to overcome. It also meant I had to rethink how I was going to remain involved in sport. In my roles both as a teacher and as a business owner I would have to problem solve issues ranging from safeguarding concerns, health and safety concerns to parent issues. The solution usually came from thinking about the problem, deciding on a plan of action and finally implementing the plan. If success was not achieved, I would start the process again attacking the problem from a different angle. This came in really useful when having to create an algorithm for our Crossworlde project.

- Organisation and planning: When running my business I had to coordinate with several different schools about club running times and also organising the club staffing. This required good communication skills but also for me to think about the logistics of club timings, clubs running simultaneously, the number of staff I had, child to stuff numbers ratio, contingency plans and the minimum number of customers needed and the maximum we could accept. This type of planning, organisation and proactivity was beneficial at Makers when planning projects and deciding how we would tackle them.

- Teamwork: While in my sports coaching roles at schools I had to work as part of a team, this lends myself to being a strong pair programmer. To achieve success at my previous jobs good communication was key in order to arrive at certain decisions. I also found that as well as communication skills, the environment created needs to be one where people arent afraid to suggest ideas and people should be able to bounce ideas off one another to find a final solution. Being able to work in a team was helpful when pair programming and also when working in group projects.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2021 to January 2022)
- Using Ruby, I learnt to test drive development, using RSpec, through object oriented programming.
- TDD taught me how to effectively debug and refactor applications.
- Pair programming to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- As well as Ruby I have used JavaScript and React to create projects along with HTML and CSS to style the web apps. Deployed to Heroku and used Capybara, Jest and Rspec to test.

#### The Open University (September 2017 to July 2021)

- 2.1 BSc(Hons) in Sport, Fitness and Coaching 

## Hobbies

I enjoy going to watch the football, more specifically Fulham. Along side this, I like to coach football.  I also love to cook (mainly pasta), am into fitness and gaming.
