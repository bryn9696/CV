## Bryn Williams

I am an entrepreneur at heart. Since 2015 I have worked in various roles in physical education (PE) and this inspired me to start my own business, running sports clubs, in 2019. Throughout this, technology has always excited me thinking about how technologies can and do play a role in sport. As someone familiar with the problems in sport and I want to be a part of the solution, this lead me to complete the Makers academy bootcamp and retrain as a software developer. The innovation and need to problem solve in the technology industry is what appeals to me.
At the Makers academy I learnt the key skills required to develop full stack web apps using predominantly Ruby but also JavaScript and React. As well as teaching me how to code effectively, Makers taught me the importance of continuous learning.

## Work Experience

**Sports Specialists Limited** (2018 to 2021)  
Director
I built this company from nothing to operating across 3 schools, with 5 clubs and holiday camps.

- Organising: Allocating which staff were at which location and allocating lead coach's for each site to deliver exceptional sport sessions.
- Planning: Pairing coaches who could work well together to enable smooth running sessions.
- Flexibility and adaptability: Adjusting when staff were out or for any conflicts arose.
- Managing customer database: Inputting and maintaining customer information.
- Problem solving: Point of contact for staff and customers who had any problems or issues as well as being the person to sort any logistical problems. This lead to a smoother running of the company.

**Royal Kent School** (2019 to 2021)  
Sports Coach

- Lesson planning: Required good teamwork, being coordinated with the PE team in order to bounce ideas off each other and create effective lessons.
- Leading sports lessons: Responsible for delivering a number of sports programs across the school. This involved innovative thinking, clear communication, leadership and problem solving skills.

**Royal Kent School** (September 2018 â€“ August 2021)
Learning Support Assistant

- Small group work: Attention to detail in order to see how children were working and aiding them through their learning.

**Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School** (September 2015 - July 2017)
Surbiton High Boys Preparatory School

- Managing Sports Teams: Every term, I was given a team to manage for matches and tournaments. Therefore, I had to be organised in setting up training sessions, decisive in picking teams and making decisions on match days.

## Skills

- Problem Solving: I got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2014. This meant that my walking ability slowly deteriorated. This means I now come across daily challenges in general life which I have to work out ways to overcome. It also meant I had to rethink how I was going to remain involved in sport. In my roles both as a teacher and as a business owner I would have to problem solve issues ranging from safeguarding concerns, health and safety concerns to parent issues. The solution usually came from thinking about the problem, deciding on a plan of action and finally implementing the plan. If success was not achieved, I would start the process again attacking the problem from a different angle. This came in really useful when having to create an algorithm for our Crossworlde project.

- Organisation and planning: When running my business I had to coordinate with several different schools about club running times and also organising the club staffing. This required good communication skills but also for me to think about the logistics of club timings, clubs running simultaneously, the number of staff I had, child to stuff numbers ratio, contingency plans and the minimum number of customers needed and the maximum we could accept. This type of planning, organisation and proactivity was beneficial at Makers when planning projects and deciding how we would tackle them.

- Teamwork: While in my sports coaching roles at schools I had to work as part of a team, this lends myself to being a strong pair programmer. To achieve success at my previous jobs good communication was key in order to arrive at certain decisions. I also found that as well as communication skills, the environment created needs to be one where people arent afraid to suggest ideas and people should be able to bounce ideas off one another to find a final solution. Being able to work in a team was helpful when pair programming and also when working in group projects.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2021 to January 2022)
- Using Ruby, I learnt to test drive development, using RSpec, through object oriented programming.
- TDD taught me how to effectively debug and refactor applications.
- Pair programming to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- As well as Ruby I have used JavaScript and React to create projects along with HTML and CSS to style the web apps. Deployed to Heroku and used Capybara, Jest and Rspec to test.

#### The Open University (September 2017 to July 2021)

- 2.1 BSc(Hons) in Sport, Fitness and Coaching 

## Hobbies

I enjoy going to watch the football, more specifically Fulham. Along side this, I like to coach football.  I also love to cook (mainly pasta), am into fitness and gaming.
